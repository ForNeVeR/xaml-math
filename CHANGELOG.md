# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] (2.1.1)
### Changed
- The exception classes are now `sealed` (should not break anything, since there never was any sense in extending them in the user code).

## [2.1.0] - 2023-07-15
### Changed
- AvaloniaMath is now based on (and thus compatible with) Avalonia 11.

### Fixed
- [#272: Parser crash on `\left{2+2\right\}`][issue-272].

## [2.0.0] - 2023-06-11
Although a major release with certain formally breaking changes, these changes should hopefully not break any normal usage of the library (if the user code doesn't implement own `IElementRenderer`).

### Changed
- **(Breaking!)** Avalonia: rename `AvaloniaBrushExtensions` to `AvaloniaExtensions`.
- **(Breaking!)** WPF: rename `WpfBrushExtensions` to `WpfExtensions`.
- **(Breaking!)** `IElementRenderer` is now required to implement a new method, `RenderLine` (required for the new `\cancel*` commands).

### Added
- [`jlm_msam10.ttf` font with a lot of new characters][pull-400], thanks @Orace, that closes the following requests:
  - [`angle`, `measuredangle`, and `square` symbols are not rendered][issue-127],
  - [An unsupported command `\geqslant`][issue-313].
- New commands: `\cancel`, `\bcancel`, `\xcancel` (partially addressing [issue #349][issue-349]), thanks @Orace.

### Fixed
- [#409: Exception on empty matrix row][issue-409].

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-30
### Fixed
- [#387: Alignment issue in matrix with an empty cell][issue-387], thanks @Orace.
- [#389: Padding is not respected with `\cases`][issue-389], thanks @Orace.

### Added
- [#381: Support for `\begin{align}`][issue-381], thanks @Orace.
- The README file is now packed into NuGet for better documentation.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-02-07
### Changed
- The project has been renamed to XAML-Math. This doesn't change the NuGet package names (WpfMath and AvaloniaMath) and their contents (including namespaces of most entities), but changed the contents of the shared assembly.
- **(Breaking change.)** `WpfMath.Shared` assembly was renamed to `XamlMath.Shared`:
  - a lot of types were migrated from `WpfMath` namespace to `XamlMath`,
  - all the internal XML file resources were migrated to the new namespace as well.
- The `XamlMath.Shared` assembly has been extracted into a separately published NuGet package.
- **(Breaking change.)** WPF-Math no longer supports .NET Framework 4.5.2, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET 5.0, because they are out of support by Microsoft. The only supported runtimes are:
  - .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later,
  - .NET 6.0 and later.
- **(Breaking change.)** `WpfMath.Colors.IColorParser::Parse` now accepts `IReadOnlyList` instead of `IEnumerable`.
- **(Minor breaking change.)** `XamlMath.Colors.StandardColorParsers::Dictionary` static public field is now `readonly`.
- **(Minor breaking change.)** `WpfMath.Rendering.WpfBrushFactory`'s constructor is now `private`.
- **(Minor breaking change.)** `WpfMath.Rendering.WpfBrushFactory::Instance` static public field is now `readonly`.

### Removed
- **(Breaking change.)** Delete the `TexRenderer` class. Use extension methods from `WpfMath.Rendering.WpfTeXFormulaExtensions` and `WpfMath.Rendering.TeXFormulaExtensions` to replace its functionality in your code.

### Added
- Avalonia version is now available! Install the **AvaloniaMath** NuGet package to get it.

  It supports the following .NET variants:
  - .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later,
  - .NET Standard 2.0 or later,
  - .NET 6.0 or later.
- Portable PDB packages are now published to NuGet.

## [0.13.1] - 2023-01-29
### Fixed
- [#350: Unable to resolve dependency 'WpfMath.Shared'][issue-350]

## [0.13.0] - 2023-01-27
### Changed
- **(Breaking change.)** The library is now distributed in the form of two assemblies: `WpfMath` and `WpfMath.Shared` (as a future cross-platform core of the library).

  Both of the assemblies are still distributed in the same NuGet package.

  A lot of types were moved to `WpfMath.Shared` assembly (preserving their namespaces).
- **(Breaking change.)** It is no longer recommended to create instances of `TexEnvironment` using the public constructor. Use `WpfMath.Rendering.WpfTeXEnvironment::Create` instead.
- **(Breaking change.)** It is no longer recommended to create instances of `TexFormulaParser` using public constructors. Use `WpfMath.Parsers.WpfTeXFormulaParser::Instance` instead.
- **(Breaking change.)** WPF-specific `WpfMath.Rendering.IBrush` has been replaced with `WpfMath.Rendering.IBrush` in most of the public interfaces. Use `WpfMath.Rendering.WpfBrushExtensions` to convert back and forth to the WPF type.
- **(Breaking change.)** `WpfMath.Rendering.IElementRenderer` has been updated:
  - `RenderGlyphRun` has been replaced with `RenderCharacter` method (not reliant on any WPF-specific types),
  - `RenderRectangle` now receives an instance of a new `WpfMath.Rendering.Rectangle` type (decoupled from WPF).
- `WpfMath.TexRenderer` is now obsolete. Consult the documentation on new recommended ways to perform custom rendering. There are new extension methods in two classes (`WpfMath.Rendering.WpfTeXFormulaExtensions` and `WpfMath.Rendering.TeXFormulaExtensions`) that are the main way to render formulae now.
- **(Breaking change.)** `WpfMath.TexFormnula::GetRenderer` is gone. Create a `TexRenderer` using constructor (obsolete) or use the aforementioned extension methods instead.

### Added
- `WpfMath.CharInfo`: a new public type to work with a font character. Use `WpfMath.Fonts.WpfCharInfoEx::GetGlyphRun` if you need to get a `System.Windows.Media.GlyphRun` from it.
- `WpfMath.Rendering.WpfTeXFormulaExtensions` to render a `WpfMath.TexFormula` into a `System.Windows.Media.Imaging.BitmapSource` or `System.Windows.Media.Geometry`.
- New classes for WPF-Math porting to platforms other than WPF (consult the `WpfMath.Rendering.IElementRenderer` interface and `TexFormulaParser` constructor parameters to know more).
- `WpfMath.Colors.RgbaColor` as a new portable color representation.
- `WpfMath.Fonts.IFontProvider`: implement this interface to provide alternate font reading functionality.
- `WpfMath.Fonts.ITeXFont`: implement this interface to provide access to a platform-specific font resource.
- `WpfMath.Rendering.IBrushFactory`: implement this interface to provide access to creation of platform-specific solid-colored brushes.
- `WpfMath.TeXFontMetrics` that contains some measurements of a font glyph.
- A utility `Result` struct is now public.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-01-07
### Added
- TeX's environment support with only one environment for now: `\begin{pmatrix}` (see [#329][pull-329]).
