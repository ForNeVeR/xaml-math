========

*WPF-Math* is a .NET library for rendering mathematical formulae using the LaTeX typsetting style, for the WPF framework.

Getting Started
---------------

The simplest way of using *WPF-Math* is to render a static formula in a XAML file as follows.

```xml
<Window ... xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:WpfMath.Controls;assembly=WpfMath">
    <controls:FormulaControl Formula="\left(x^2 + 2 \cdot x + 2\right) = 0" />
</Window>
```

For a more detailed sample, check out the [example project][example]. It shows the usage of data binding and some advanced concepts.

History
-------

The library was originally ported from the [JMathTex project][jmathtex], copyright 2004-2007 Universiteit Gent. The port was originally named *WPF-TeX* and was written and maintained by [Alex Regueiro][alex-regueiro]. It was later available as [*WPF-Math* on Launchpad][launchpad], but was unmaintained from 2011 until it was revived in [its current form][github].
