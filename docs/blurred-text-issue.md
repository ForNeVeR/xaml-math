How to improve blurred formulas
======================================================

Since `FormulaControl` is a WPF control it has `TextOptions` properties 
to tune how formulas are rendered. Default settings provides smooth and 
clear output for large font sizes, but for smaller ones it may looks 
blurred. It's a personal preference, and if you are unhappy with default 
settings you may override it by creating custom style:

```xml
<Window ... xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:WpfMath.Controls;assembly=WpfMath">
    <Window.Resources>
        <Style x:Key="ClearTypeFormula" TargetType="controls:FormulaControl">
            <Setter Property="TextOptions.TextRenderingMode" Value="ClearType" />
            <Setter Property="TextOptions.TextHintingMode" Value="Fixed" />
            <Setter Property="TextOptions.TextFormattingMode" Value="Display" />
        </Style>
    </Window.Resources>

    <controls:FormulaControl Formula="\left(x^2 + 2 \cdot x + 2\right) = 0"
                             Style="{StaticResource ClearTypeFormula}" />
</Window>
```

Let's see on output for different settings.

- ClearType style:

Second formula looks great with sharp symbols! But for larger font size it 
might be not pleasible, so you may want to experiment with WPF rendering 
options further.

If you still have problems with blurred/noisy formulas, please tell us in 
this [umbrella issue](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/wpf-math/issues/50). We 
are trying hard to achieve best-looking rendering on WPF, but sometimes it 
might be tricky.

Thanks!
